\section{Background} % (fold)
\label{sec:background}
This toolbox was developed to implement the necesarry functions for making room acoustic measurements with \emph{MATLAB}. The functions can be used as building blocks to make measurements with any computer that has \emph{MATLAB} and a soundcard.\\

\subsection{About the authors} % (fold)
\label{sub:about_the_authors}
The toolbox was developed by three students from \emph{Technical University of Denmark}. All three are master students in engineering acoustics with an interest in room and build acoustics. The development of this toolbox started with the need for a simple and freely available tool to perform room acoustic measurements.

\section{Installation} % (fold)
\label{sec:installation}
The newest version of this toolbox can be downloaded from \url{https://github.com/duhalde/rabat}. After downloading the toolbox the path should be added in \emph{MATLAB}. This can be done through the menu \emph{File$\>$Set Path} or using the \texttt{pathtool}-command.\\
\\
Performing measurements requires that PsychToolbox\footnote{See \url{http://psychtoolbox.org/HomePage}, for information on how to install it} is installed. PsychToolbox contains functionality that allows for low-latency asynchrounous playback and recording of audio signal on multiple platforms.
